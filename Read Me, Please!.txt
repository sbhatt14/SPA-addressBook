There are 4 folders in the project.

1) Content, it has the CSS files in it.
2) Data contains stock photos.
3) Scripts - has two subfolders
	-KO - Knockout, for part of the project I have used Knockout MVVM for databinding this is 
	used to display the more information about any person, when one clicks on the picture of a 
	particular contact. Knockout databinding is easy to implement, the datastore contains the information about
	all the contacts. The fields of the contacts are set up as an observable variables and the values are returned 
	in the HTML code by using the applyBinding method.
	
	-object - where the datastore contains the method embedded in which is the contact information to be parsed 
	and binded to knockout. The variables of the contact list are set up as type observable here. The context method is 
	also defined here for the SPA. These context are set via HTML where on being called the appropriate divs are shown/hidden.

4) Views - This is where the webpage resides. The home page also displays a table which is populated using data parsed from the people.json
	    document. The databinding here takes place without Knockout, I have made use of AJAX so that JavaScript can retrieve the information
	    stored in JSON files, parse them and populate the table.


Cross Browser Compatibility - Chrome won't allow loading local json files with ajax (error - XMLHttpRequest)  even when I explicity use these commands
chrome.exe --disable-web-security
chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files

As of now the webpage just works with Firefox. Since firefox will allow loading local files.
